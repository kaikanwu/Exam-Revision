And I have been warned from a previous student that SPM had massive marks for something not covered in depth.

SPM is full of missing stuff, but if you answer the previous papers you will find all the information needed. Now I am answering the 2016 paper is pain because in stead of 2 hours I need more to find the missed information in the lectures, but we cannot do anything about it....

The Spiral method is covered in a slide, the question asks for details... sucks
